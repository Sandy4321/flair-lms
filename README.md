# `flair-lms`

This repository is part of the NLP research with
[`flair`](https://github.com/flairNLP/flair), a state-of-the-art NLP
framework from [Zalando Research](https://research.zalando.com/).

This repository will include various language models (forward and backward) that
can be used with `flair`. It will be updated frequently. So please star or watch
this repository ðŸ˜…

## Multilingual Flair Embeddings

Multilingual Flair Embeddings were trained on the recently released
[JW300](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1310/) corpus. Thanks to half precision support in
Flair, both forward and backward Embeddings were trained for 5 epochs for over 10 days.
The training corpus has 2,025,826,977 token.

| Language model   | # Tokens | Forward ppl. | Backward ppl. | Flair Embeddings alias
| ---------------- | -------- | ------------ | ------------- | -----------------------------
| JW300            | 2B       | 3.25         | 3.37          | `multi-forward` and `multi-backward`


It can be loaded with:

```python
from flair.embeddings import FlairEmbeddings

jw_forward = FlairEmbeddings("multi-forward")
jw_backward = FlairEmbeddings("multi-backward")
```

A detailed evaluation on various PoS tagging tasks can be found in
[this repository](https://github.com/stefan-it/flair-pos-tagging).

We would like to thank Å½eljko AgiÄ‡ for providing us access to the corpus
(before it was officially released)!
